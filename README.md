## Yaroslav Fedorenko
  Hello my name is Yaroslav. I am a passionate software developer based in Winnipeg, Canada.
  I have my bachelors in Information Systems and currently going trough Software Developer
  program in MITT, Winnipeg, CA.

  Back in 2008 I worked on a x-ray digital shots photo filter, my code cleared
  angular darkening, random noises and broken pixels (that was a big thing back then).
  Thus I can claim I did photofilters before it became a mainstream.
